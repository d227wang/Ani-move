1. Extract compressed file "Ani-move.exe" and place it in a folder that either contains unsorted anime files, or contains subfolders that contain unsorted anime files

2. Run "Ani-move.exe"

3.  Program will move all anime files in the current directory (and it's subdirectories) to an anime root directory (By default @".../Users/<CurrentUser>/Videos/Anime/"). It will rename the anime file to the format "<Anime Title> - <Episode Number>" and move it to  @".../Users/<CurrentUser>/Videos/Anime/<Anime Title>".

The exe file will move whatever it finds in the directory (and subdirectories) that it's currently executed in. So by simply moving the "Ani-move.exe" file to another directory, you can effectively combine scattered anime files across your hard drive to one central, organized, collection.

**Warning:**
It is unwise to run this program directory in @"C://". I have not added robust exception handling, so use with care. At its worst, it will only interact with files matching the schema "[*- *".
